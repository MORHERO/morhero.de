                    <p>
                        Most of my projects are web projects. Like this website here.<br/><br/>
                        I have a big interrest in game development. The biggest game project im currently working on is Bugclicker. It´s still in a very early phase but I have many Ideas for it.<br/><br/>
                        Besides programming I really enjoy worldbuilding and Pen&Paper Games. Thats the reason for my only writing project "<a href="<?php echo($url); ?>project/guarded-worlds/">Guarded Worlds</a>".

                    <h3>Besides my projects.</h3>
                    <p>Most of the time when im not working on one of my projects im playing games. Mostly CS:GO and everything new that sounds intresting.<br/>After gaming its the typical Netflix, Amazon Prime bullshit. Nothing special. </p>
